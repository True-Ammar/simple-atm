# Simple ATM Program

This is a simple C program that simulates an ATM machine. I built it as my first real project after completing Week 1 of CS50. The idea was to use the concepts I’ve learned so far like `variables`, `conditions`, `loops`, and `functions`.

## 💡 Program Idea

The program starts by asking the user to enter a 5-digit PIN. If the PIN is correct, the user gets access to a menu with four options:
1. View balance
2. Withdraw cash
3. Deposit cash
4. Exit

The user can repeat these operations until they choose to exit. The program keeps track of the balance and updates it based on the user’s actions.

## ✅ Concepts Used
- `int` variables to store the PIN, balance, and amounts
- `if / else` statements to check conditions
- `while` loop to keep the menu running
- `get_int` from the CS50 library to get user input
- `functions` to organize the code

## 🔍 Notes

This project helped me practice writing real logic using basic C. I tried to keep the code clean and readable, and I didn’t use advanced concepts I haven’t studied yet. My goal was to make it work using only what I’ve learned so far.
